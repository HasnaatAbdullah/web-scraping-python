# 🕸️ Web Scraping using Python & BeautifulSoup

Hi, I'm **Hasnaat Abdullah** 👋  

This is my **Web Scraping** project where I practiced using **Python** and the **BeautifulSoup** library to scrape and extract information from websites.  
In this lab, I learned how to navigate through HTML documents, work with tags, attributes, and extract specific data from webpages.

## 📌 What I Learned

- How to create and use a **BeautifulSoup object**.
- Understanding **HTML tags**, **children**, **parents**, and **siblings**.
- How to extract **HTML attributes** and **navigable strings**.
- How to use **filters** to search for elements.
- Using **find()** and **find_all()** to extract data.
- Downloading and scraping **webpage contents**.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries I Used

- **Python 3**
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**
- **Requests**
- **lxml / html.parser**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
